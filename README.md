# Simple Weather
A very simple weather app for iOS using the [forecast.io API](http://forecast.io/).

This project was done to learn about the development workflow when using XCode and Swift. 

I did not have much experience with Swift and iOS development in general before starting the project, and the finished project might therefore not follow all iOS and Swift best practices.
